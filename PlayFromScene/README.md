## 267 Industries - Script: PlayFromScene

This script is very handy when you have multiple scenes and you always need to start from a certain scene because of gameobjects that are created and not been destroyed, because they are used within the entire game.

When adding this script to your project you can select the start scene. When you press start, your game will start from that scene entire and when you press stop Unity will go back to the scene where you were working on.
